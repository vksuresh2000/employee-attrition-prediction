# Employee Attrition Prediction

This project implements a machine learning model to predict employee attrition based on various employee attributes. The project includes the dataset, Python code for prediction, and related files.

## Project Overview
Employee attrition is a critical challenge for organizations. This project uses historical employee data to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## Files
- `EmpAttrnGUI_TKIntr.py`: Python script implementing the attrition prediction with a graphical user interface.
- `employee_attrition_dataset.csv`: Dataset containing employee attributes and attrition status.
- `TestPerformanceJobFit.csv`: Additional test dataset for model evaluation.

## Dataset Source
The dataset is based on the [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset). Please refer to the original dataset page for license and usage terms.

## Installation and Usage
1. Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.7+).
2. Install necessary libraries:
3. Run the Python script:
4. Follow the GUI prompts to use the attrition prediction functionality.
